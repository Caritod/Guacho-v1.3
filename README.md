# Guacho v1.3
Guacho is a 3D hydrodynamical/magnetohydrodynamical code suited for astrophysical fluids.
The equations are evolved with a number of approximate Riemann solvers, it includes various modules to deal with different cooling regimes, and a radiation transfer module based on a Monte Carlo ray tracing method.
It can run sequentially or in parallel with MPI.

Current version has enough changes to deserve be renamed as v1.3, only the chemH and EXO problems have been updated, the other examples are kept in the folder Guacho-1.2-examples/ and they will be updated as time permits.

It is freely distributed under GPL v3 license.
